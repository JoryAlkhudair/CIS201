    My name is Jory Alkhudair, and I'm a second-year Al-Yamamah University Network Engineer student. Web development, cybersecurity, and Object-Oriented Programming are some of my skills. Data mining, machine learning, cyber security, and networking are all topics that fascinate me. I consider myself to be a quick learner who is constantly motivated to tackle new challenges. I enjoy volunteering and giving back to the community as much as possible through charitable endeavors.
